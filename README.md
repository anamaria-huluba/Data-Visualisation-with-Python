# Data-Visualisation-with-Python

Firstly, I used Matplotlib - a Python library that allowed me to create charts and graphs, in order to build a portfolio of projects to better demonstrate my presenting and organising skills of data in Python.

Through the first project, Sublime Limes' Line Graphs, I wanted to showcase my understanding of how to build and label a line graph. 
The concepts covered include:
- Creating a line graph from data
- Changing the appearance of the line
- Zooming in on different parts of the axis
- Putting labels on titles and axes
- Creating a more complex figure layout
- Adding legends to graphs
- Changing tick labels and positions 
- Saving what youâ€™ve made

In the second project,called Recreating_Graphs_using_Matplotlib, I've experimented with a bunch of different plot types used in Matplotlib and how to best use them to find patterns or trends in a new data set, adding plotting abilities to my repertoire, including:
- How to compare categories of data with bar graphs
- Add error bars to graphs
- Use fill_between to display shaded error on line graphs
- Create stacked bar graphs for easier comparisons
- Create side-by-side bar graphs
- Create and format pie charts to compare proportional datasets
- Analyze frequency data using histograms, including multiple histograms on the same plot
- Normalize histograms
