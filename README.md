# Data-Visualisation-with-Python

I will be using Matplotlib, a Python library that allows me to create charts and graphs, in order to build a portfolio of projects to better demonstrate my presenting and organizing skills of data in Python.

Through the first project, Sublime Limes' Line Graphs, I want to showcase my understanding of how I built and labelled a line graph.

The concepts covered include:

- Creating a line graph from data
- Changing the appearance of the line
- Zooming in on different parts of the axis
- Putting labels on titles and axes
- Creating a more complex figure layout
- Adding legends to graphs
- Changing tick labels and positions 
- Saving what youâ€™ve made
