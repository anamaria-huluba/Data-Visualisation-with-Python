# Data-Visualisation-with-Python

As Matplotlib is the most commonly used graphig tool in Python, the library allowed me to create charts and graphs to build a portfolio of projects to better demonstrate my presenting and organising skills.

The first two projects, Sublime Limes' Line Graphs and Recreating_Graphs_using_Matplotlib, allowed me to experiment with a bunch of different plot types and how to best use them to find patterns or trends in a new data set, adding plotting abilities to my repertoire, including: 

- Create line graphs from data
- Add labels and styling to graphs
- How to compare categories of data with bar graphs
- Add error bars to graphs
- Use fill_between to display shaded error on line graphs
- Create stacked bar graphs for easier comparisons
- Create side-by-side bar graphs
- Create and format pie charts to compare proportional datasets
- Analyze frequency data using histograms, including multiple histograms on the same plot
- Normalize histograms

For the third project, Visualizing World Cup Data With Seaborn, I used Seaborn as an add-on to Matplotlib that allowed me to style graphs more professionally and create sleeker graphics that take them to the next level. The World Cups dataset show all information about all the World Cups in the history, while the World Cup Matches dataset shows all the results from the matches contested as part of the cups.

The data comes from Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/abecklas/fifa-world-cup.
